    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection was established in 1999, and opened in a dedicated facility at 27 Christopher Street in Manhattan in November 2004.  The Center was founded to provide community-based preventive services and therapy for children and families damaged by abuse and neglect, as well as training and education programs for child-care professionals.  It also housed a research and devlopment department studying interventions against child abuse to discern best practices.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The center was initiated by, and named after, Dr. Vincent J. Fontana, Medical Director of the New York Foundling Hospital from March 1962 until his July 2005 death. In his campaign against child abuse, he was the author of The Maltreated Child (1964) and Somewhere a Child is Crying (1973), among other books, articles and papers. He was also an allergy specialist.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries contains materials related to Vincent Fontana and to the Fontana Center.  Materials are arranged chronologically and include many articles, books, and other materials by and about Dr. Fontana created prior to the institution of the Fontana Center.  Documents specific to the center itself appear in the period 1999-2008.  There are also circa 250 photographic prints of Dr. Fontana and the Fontana Center, arranged at the end of the subseries. A few other photographic prints in this subseries are housed in Box 27, Folder 4.</field>
