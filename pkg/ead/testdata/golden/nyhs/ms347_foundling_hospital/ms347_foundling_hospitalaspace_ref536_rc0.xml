    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries IV.30. Orphan Train, 1904-2002</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries contains correspondence, blank forms, clippings, and photographic prints related to the program through which children were sent by the Foundling to live with families in the country, arranged chronologically, with newsletters by the Orphan Train Heritage Society and other non-Foundling publications at the end of the subseries.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the material relates either to the 1904 "Arizona Incident," in which a mob of non-Catholic Anglo families forcibly removed children from Catholic Mexican families with whom they had been placed by the Foundling, or to reunions, correspondence, or newsletters of former "orphan train riders," 1962-2002.  In between, there is one vintage photographic print of a group of orphan train riders, and one folder of blank forms.  There is no 19th century material.  Case files from the "orphan train" are in the possession of the N.Y. Foundling Hospital and are not part of this collection. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes from the boarding department are in Series XIV and are restricted.  For unrestricted materials, see also subseries IV. 3 - Adoption, and IV.6 - Boarding Department. There are several published volumes about the orphan train and the "Arizona Incident" in Series XVII.    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 1873 the Foundling began chartering trains (now known as "orphan trains") to carry children to Catholic families in Maryland, and later to other states in the West and South.  The Foundling's placing-out program was part of a larger movement, run by many organizations from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1920s.  During this period, tens of thousands of children without families willing or able to care for them were transported out of the city to country homes, contributing to the country's westward expansion.  Most children from New York City were sent either by the Children's Aid Society (beginning in 1853) or the Foundling (beginning 20 years later).  Families receiving children from the Foundling signed a document agreeing to raise the child Catholic, and giving the institution legal right to remove the "indentured" child should the placement prove unsatisfactory.  Before children went west, they lived and attended nursery school at the Foundling.</field>
