    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries is arranged with mixed materials (correspondence, pamphlets, minutes, a textbook, newsletters) arranged chronologically, followed by a nearly complete set of yearbooks from most graduating classes 1948-1965 and 1970, followed by circa 100 photographic prints 1936-1964. Three yearbooks from 1948 also contain photographic prints, attached with photocorners.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence in the series appears to have been grouped to reflect the program at three milestone points -- its inception, its shift to becoming a child care training program, and its closing.  There is no correspondence from intervening years.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For related material, please see Series XVI - Nurse's Capes, as well Series IV.29, Nursery School.  Foundling nurses and nurses-in-training worked with the children of the nursery school, and the programs shared a director and staff.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Foundling operated a school for baby nurses beginning in 1927.  Between 1941 and 1950 the program went through a state of flux, as St. John's Children's Hospital at the Foundling closed and the mission of the nursing school changed to reflect the mission of the Foundling -- to care for dependent or neglected children, rather than sick children.  State certifying agencies also expressed concern that Foundling students trained in the care of well babies and children should not be confused with practical or registered nurses trained and licensed to work with sick babies and children.  Beginning around 1950, students graduating from the Foundling's year-long residential program were formally known as Infant and Child Care Technicians; informally they were still often called baby nurses. They received a Foundling diploma and pin, recited the Baby Nurse Pledge and wore a nurse's uniform and cap, but were not licensed nurses.  In the late 1960's the program was renamed the School of Child Care Workers, and then the School for Infant and Child Care, with graduates continuing to wear the uniform, cap and pin. The program was phased out in 1973.</field>
