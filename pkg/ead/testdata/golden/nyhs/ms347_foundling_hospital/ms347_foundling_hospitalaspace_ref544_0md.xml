    <field name="scopecontent_teim">St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea opened on Staten Island in 1910 as an overflow center for children and mothers, to supplement the Foundling's facilities on 68th Street.  The property was a gift to the Sisters of Charity from Charles and Eugenia Schwab, and the center was at first known as "the Eugenia Schwab."  The Sisters of Charity repurposed the location as a high school in 1963. The last Foundling children left the property around 1965. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes, but is not limited to, administrative correspondence, inspection reports and legal documents, and photographic prints and other visual materials.  The records document the center from prior to its donation until after it closed as a Foundling facility, but there are no records from its current incarnation as a high school.  Folders are arranged chronologically, with miscellaneous and photographic materials at the end.  Photographic prints are also affixed to a 1935 document.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes created at the center, including baptism and intake books, are arranged in the St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea subseries of Series XIV - Records of Children and Mothers.  Volumes in that series are restricted.</field>
