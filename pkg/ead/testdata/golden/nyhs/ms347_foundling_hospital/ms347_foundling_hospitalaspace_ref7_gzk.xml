    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series VII. Foundling Publications - Pamphlets, Appeals, Newsletters, 1909-2009</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series is divided into two subseries:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">VII.1 - Pamphlets, Appeals, Public Relations Publications, 1909-2007</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">VII.2 - Newsletters, 1955-2009</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">VII.1 includes pamphlets and other materials produced both for fundraising purposes, and to promote services to clients.  The materials promoting services describe either an array of Foundling services or else programs for which no other subseries exists in this collection.  Pamphlets for specific programs may be found in Series IV - Centers, Programs and Departments, and Series V - Records of the St. Agatha Home.  Materials are arranged chronologically.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">VII.2 includes Foundling newsletters published for external and/or internal audiences.  Some newsletters were intended for both groups.  
VII.2 begins with bound copies of Mater Dei, originally a monthly publication of the Foundling's Association of Foster Parents, although the Association's name was dropped from the banner with the April 1963 issue, possibly reflecting the newsletter's more general distribution and wide-ranging subject matter.  Mater Dei published the Foundling's Annual Report as its March issue each year from 1958-1966. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For other Annual Reports and unbound copies of some of the Mater Dei Annual Report issues, see Series II - Annual Reports.  For newsletters from specific programs, see Series IV - Centers, Programs and Departments, and Series V - Records of the St. Agatha Home.</field>
