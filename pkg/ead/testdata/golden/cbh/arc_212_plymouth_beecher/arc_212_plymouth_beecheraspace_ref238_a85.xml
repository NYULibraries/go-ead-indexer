    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains materials that primarily concern Plymouth Church. Although certain items document the church during Henry Ward Beecher's tenure, their primary use is in documenting the activities of the church, rather than those of Beecher. In addition to church records, this series includes papers of and regarding four of Beecher's successors at Plymouth Church. The series also includes some material from Church of the Pilgrims and, to a lesser extent, other churches in Brooklyn and elsewhere.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series contains church publications, including the monthly Plymouth Chimes, church bulletins, church manuals, articles of faith, miscellaneous programs, annual reports, and other print matter. Records of Plymouth Church in the series include those relating to membership, such as a parish book, a shareholders' book, pew rental charts, and a list of applicants to the church.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes materials pertaining to the Sunday/Sabbath Schools, such as rosters, hymn books, sheet music, and programs for Sunday School events. The many organizations that were affiliated with Plymouth Church and Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims are represented in this section with material such as programs, membership rosters, and news clippings. The organizations represented include the Plymouth League, the Bethel Mission, Work Committee, Men's and Women's Clubs, the Arbuckle Institute, Plymouth Institute, and Plymouth Church house.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Lyman Abbott, Newell Dwight Hillis, J. Stanley Durkee, and L. Wendell Fifield , the four pastors immediately following Henry Ward Beecher at Plymouth, are represented in the series with writings, sermons, news clippings, and ephemera. The series also includes materials pertaining to the general history, architecture, and notable members and leaders of Plymouth Church. Materials relating to Paxton Hibben's 1927 biography of Beecher are in the series. Several scrapbooks compiled by members of the congregation are found in the series; among these are one compiled with substantive annotations by Horatio C. King (circa 1901-1907) and one with political ephemera from the 1870s-1880s.</field>
