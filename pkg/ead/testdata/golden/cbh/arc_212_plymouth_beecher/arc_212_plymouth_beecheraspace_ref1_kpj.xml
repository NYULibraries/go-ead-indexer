Also included within the correspondence section of the series is a copy of Beecher's letter of acceptance of the pastorate at Plymouth Church.</field><field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes a section of miscellaneous personal materials relating to Beecher, such as a scrapbook of his final journey to England and a stock certificate, as well as materials pertaining to other members of the Beecher family, including his wife Eunice White Bullard, his sister Harriet Beecher Stowe, and his son William.  As a whole, the section of personal and familial papers is primarily made up of correspondence and newspaper clippings.
