    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The administrative records of Russell D. Niles measure 11
            linear feet and span the years 1964-1966. The material
            has been processed into three chronological series
            representing each of the academic years of Niles&#39; term,
            and a fourth series consists of administrative topics,
            Deans&#39; Council minutes and mission statements originally
            set apart from the chronological series. The first
            series contains a small number of records from the final
            months of the George Stoddard administration. The third
            series, covering the academic year 1965-1966, was
            insufficiently processed by a student in the fall of
            1987 and the finding aid to that series is not, in its
            present state, reliable. The excessive bulk in the Niles
            collection can be attributed, to a large extent, to the
            processing problems in series III. It must also be noted
            that the subseries on all-university departments in
            series II contains material spanning Niles&#39; first two
            academic years, 1963-1964 and 1964-1965. Some files
            covering student grievances, the transfer of faculty
            members from one school to another, and specific faculty
            student relations are restricted.
          </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In relation to the previous subgroups, Niles&#39; records
            contain a substantial number of files composed of
            material on spaces and buildings (most notably in series
            III, subseries IV), reflecting the many proposed and
            actual physical changes taking place at NYU at this
            time. A file on the President of the University refers
            to NYU&#39;s attempt to acquire the Worlds Fair Spanish
            Pavilion and the Astor estate in Rhinebeck, New York.
            There are signs indicating the pending shutdown of the
            University Heights Campus and the subsequent need to
            strengthen Washington Square.
          </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files record changes that resulted from the
            Self-Study Final Report and the Ford Foundation study,
            such as the upgrading of admissions and efforts to
            achieve increased centralization. Mission statements
            (series IV, subseries III) demonstrate how well the
            schools and divisions meet the recommendations of the
            Self Study in planning their futures. Of particular
            interest are a series of files on &#34;Project Apex,&#34; a
            program designed to train high-school students to teach
            in poverty stricken areas. In addition, the first series
            contains a report on early experiments with LSD.
          </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Niles was committed to building a strong central core
            around the arts and sciences at NYU, making
            undergraduate schools his priority. The files attest to
            his goals and movement toward centralization that the
            Office of Chancellor and Executive Vice President was
            largely responsible for promoting. Niles&#39; administrative
            records show him to be in touch with all aspects of
            University operations and demonstrates the growth of the
            position since the first years of David Henry&#39;s term.
