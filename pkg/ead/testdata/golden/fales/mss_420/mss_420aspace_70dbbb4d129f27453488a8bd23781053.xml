This series also contains Bard College publications from the mid-1960s, including Gesamtwerk and Bard Psychology Journal of which Camicia served as editor and writer. Other published material in this series includes a poetry book The Divas of Sheridan Square which Camicia eventually adapted into a Hot Peaches show, and his 2013 book My Dear, Sweet Self: A Hot Peach Life which recounts Camicia&#39;s early life and the history of Hot Peaches. This series also contains articles written by Camicia about his experiences performing and traveling in Europe with the Hot Peaches cast. His loose poetry and a mock-up of a children&#39;s book are also in this series. Documentation related to Camicia&#39;s struggle with his landlord to maintain his rent-controlled apartment in New York provides insight into the struggles facing an artist and his housing issues during the 1980s and 1990s. This series also contains a small collection of Camicia&#39;s correspondence from the mid-1970s and 1990s.




An extensive collection of Camicia&#39;s journals are in this series dating from the 1950s to 2012 that often contain not only diary entries, but photographs; press clippings; sketches of portraits, costumes, and sets; and writing notes and ideas. These journals explore Camicia&#39;s early life while still in school, traveling in Europe as a young man, the development of Hot Peaches, relationships with cast members, and critiques on Hot Peaches shows. These journals also document the viewpoint of a gay performer and writer living in New York during the 1970s-2000s, as well as the experimental theater scene, the gay community in the West Village, and the drag and gay club scenes.</field><field name="ref_ssi">aspace_70dbbb4d129f27453488a8bd23781053</field><field name="repository_ssi">fales</field><field name="repository_sim">fales</field><field name="repository_ssm">fales</field><field name="format_sim">Archival Series</field><field name="format_ssm">Archival Series</field><field name="collection_teim">Hot Peaches Records</field><field name="author_teim">Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare, 2015, and Stacey Flatt with the assistance of Madison DeLaere, 2023 </field><field name="collection_unitid_teim">MSS.420</field><field name="series_si">Series IV.
