    <field name="abstract_teim">Hot Peaches was a drag theater company founded in 1972 by writer and performer Jimmy Camicia. The group was known for their collaborative interactions with other drag performance groups and queer revolutionaries, including cast member Marsha P. Johnson. The group was based in New York City and performed shows regularly from the 1970s to the early 2000s not only in New York clubs, but also tours in Europe. Hot Peaches was often a platform for cast members' self-expression, as well as a nurturing queer community. The Hot Peaches Records contain material connected to their performances including scripts; press clippings; show production work books; digital and analog performance recordings; cast and performance photographs; and promotional announcements and posters. This collection also contains personal material created by Jimmy Camicia including school ephemera, writings, and journals dating from the late 1950s to 2012.</field>

Performance audio and video recordings in this collection date from the 1970s to the 2000s and include not only Hot Peaches shows, but also fundraisers to assist former castmates like International Chrysis and Ian McKay. The collection also includes photographs of the cast, performances, backstage, and images from their European tours. Publicity material includes fliers, postcards, posters, and press releases. Show production work books include notated scripts, cast lists, stage directions, press clippings, and photographs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hot Peaches was a theater company working mostly in drag in New York City during the 1970s to the early 2000s. The company was founded by Jimmy Camicia in 1972, who befriended a group of drag queens in New York and was inspired to write shows for them to perform. Self-defined as as gay theater group, the Hot Peaches created shows that expressed the gay experience with a campy and political twist. Early shows were known for the castmembers' costumes, which often included vibrant, sparkling glam outfits with liberal use of platform boots, glitter, and feather boas. Camicia almost exclusively wrote the scripts, and the shows were put on three to five times per year at a variety of small theaters in Manhattan including Peach Pitts, Theater for the New City, La Mama, and Theater Genesis. The group would also occasionally do European tours, performing in England, Amsterdam, Scotland, Italy, and Germany, often providing their audiences with an experience that was not necessarily available for the gay communities in these countries. Notable cast members include the activist and performer Marsha P. Johnson, Sister Tooey, Wilhelmina Ross, Ian McKay, and Split Britches founder Peggy Shaw.</field>
