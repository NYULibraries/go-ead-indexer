Most of the topics covered by these letters are personal, relating to family matters, arranging visits, and the goings-on of everyday life. Sally&#39;s career as a writer and Anne&#39;s as a linguist are also well documented, and they often write about Belfrage&#39;s writing projects, helping to find publishers or offering criticism. Sally&#39;s participation in the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and her 1964 summer in Mississippi as a civil rights activist about which she wrote her first book, Freedom Summer, is covered in detail. There is also a short but interesting correspondence between Anne (who grew up in Paris) and Belfrage about the worker and student uprising in Paris in May 1968, especially regarding the role of the Communist Party. Most of the correspondence from Belfrage&#39;s son, Nick, is about his love life and his career as a wine taster. There is also correspondence from Belfrage&#39;s sister-in-law, Joyce Belfrage, regarding the poor health of his brother, Bruce.</field><field name="scopecontent_teim">General correspondence is mostly with political colleagues discussing their and Cedric&#39;s writing projects, current events, and developments in leftist and socialist movements. The primary correspondent in this section in Jim Aronson (1955 - 1990). While this correspondence is mostly incoming, there is a substantial amount from Belfrage to Aronson. They discuss mostly personal issues such as health, family, and their respective publishing projects. They also write about the problems of the National Guardian (see Wilfred Burchett correspondence and the National Guardian section for more) and current events. In 1979, while Aronson is teaching journalism in Peking, they have a major disagreement about China&#39;s presence in Vietnam that threatens their friendship.</field><field name="scopecontent_teim">Another primary correspondent is Claude Williams (1938-1980), a southern Marxist Christian preacher and the founder of The People&#39;s Institute of Applied Religion, about whom Belfrage wrote a biography (appearing variously as Let My People Go, 1937; South of God, 1938, A Faith to Free The People, 1944) . This correspondence is mostly about Claude&#39;s work and his collaborative unfinished book project with Belfrage, The People&#39;s Book, aka, The Scarlet Thread, a revolutionary reading of the Bible. Belfrage also corresponds with Paul Robeson (1956-1965) regarding the National Paul Robeson Committee (this correspondence is mostly with the secretary of this committee, Frank Loesser). Related to the Robeson correspondence is the correspondence of sisters Hannah and Peggy Middleton (London County Council Member for Greenwich, and Labour candidate for Parliament). This consists of letters from Peggy to Hannah about Robeson. Included are notes by Belfrage on this correspondence. W.E.B. DuBois and his wife Shirley Graham (1955-1964) correspond with Belfrage about DuBois&#39;s world tour, and a tribute to DuBois that Belfrage helps organize.</field><field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence with organizations is mostly with journals, magazines and newspapers regarding the publication of Belfrage&#39;s articles and letters to the editor. Among the journals is Third World, of which Belfrage was an editor. There is also a short but interesting correspondence with the South Paddington Labour Party (1956-1957) in which Belfrage debates whether or not to join and elaborates on his reasons for not wanting to sign an oath of &#34;political purity.&#34;</field><field name="scopecontent_teim">The second section of general correspondence is arranged alphabetically by country or region of origin.
